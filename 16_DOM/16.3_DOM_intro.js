// DOM -> Document Object Model

/*
-> when browser will parse the html file, browser will create an object(key-value pair)
-> that object is called as document
-> js has window object and add this document object inside the window as an object property
-> bcz of document object browser is capable to show us the webpage as it is
-> we can change the text, color, to know nav height anything we can do with document object model
*/

console.log(window.document); // this line will show the whole html code into a human readable format
console.dir(document); // output : #document  -> it will show the document in js format

// document is basically an object and whatever the html element is inside document they also have object
